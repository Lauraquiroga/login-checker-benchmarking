# The Login Checker Problem
**Advanced Algorithms (COSC 520) - Assignment 1**     
Author: Laura Quiroga (lquiroga)     

This project implements five algorithms—linear search, binary search, hashing, Bloom filter, and Cuckoo filter—to solve the Login Checker Problem. It also includes a numerical comparison of their performance in terms of time complexity.
